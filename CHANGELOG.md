# OSMP Changelog

#### 0.0.2 - Remove annoying debugging messages and fix auth issue.
------
* Forgot that I had some pretty annoying debug messages in the code, this removes them.
* If user left the panel then came back and was still authenticated, they would see some user data instead of the dashbaord.

#### 0.0.1 - Inital Version
------
* Stopping servers does not work yet.
* Everything else should work, but if it doesn't, open a issue.
